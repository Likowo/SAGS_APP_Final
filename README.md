# Unsolved problems:

- CORB stopping audio from playing with error; ***Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB) blocked cross-origin response***

- Could not trace how a red border was applied to my welcome <span> and 
- Deployed app on vercel.app but updates not registered. Got alert in console. ***  Due to `builds` existing in your configuration file, the Build and Development Settings defined in your Project Settings will not apply. Learn More: https://vercel.link/unused-build-settings ***

# Future Enhancements:
